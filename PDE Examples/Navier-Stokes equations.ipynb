The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluid substances. To solve these equations using a machine learning approach, especially using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), you would typically follow these high-level steps:\n","\n","Define the problem: Identify the specific Navier-Stokes problem you are trying to solve, including the geometry of the domain, boundary conditions, initial conditions, and any specific parameters like viscosity and density.\n","Generate or collect data: For supervised learning, you would need training data, which could be generated through numerical simulations (e.g., using Computational Fluid Dynamics software) or collected from experiments.\n","Design the neural network architecture: Choose a neural network architecture that is suitable for the problem. PINNs often use fully connected layers, but the exact architecture can vary based on the complexity of the problem.\n","Define the loss function: The loss function should include terms that enforce the Navier-Stokes equations within the domain, as well as terms that enforce initial and boundary conditions.\n","Train the model: Use an optimization algorithm to train the neural network by minimizing the loss function. During training, the neural network learns to approximate the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations that satisfies the given conditions.\n","Validate the model: Test the trained model on validation data that was not seen during training to evaluate its performance and accuracy in solving the Navier-Stokes equations.\n","Refine and iterate: Based on the validation results, you may need to adjust the neural network architecture, training data, or optimization procedure.\n","Here's a very high-level example of how you might structure the code in Python using TensorFlow:"],"metadata":{"id":"zMheiG2U07rO"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":246},"id":"5K24mzx704wi","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1706256911916,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":343,"user":{"displayName":"Tarence Rice","userId":"03741025851338500005"}},"outputId":"f4887f25-abb2-4869-8858-5a352b23bfab"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'training_inputs' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-2-d2d7511634c8>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 64>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     64\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mepoch\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mrange\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnum_epochs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     65\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32mwith\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtf\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mGradientTape\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtape\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 66\u001b[0;31m         \u001b[0mloss\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnavier_stokes_loss\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtraining_inputs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     67\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mgradients\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtape\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mgradient\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mloss\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtrainable_variables\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     68\u001b[0m     \u001b[0moptimizer\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mapply_gradients\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mzip\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mgradients\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtrainable_variables\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'training_inputs' is not defined"]}],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Define the neural network architecture\n","class FluidNet(tf.keras.Model):\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        super(FluidNet, self).__init__()\n","        #
